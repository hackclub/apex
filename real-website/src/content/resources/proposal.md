So, you've signed up for Apex! That's great! This guide will help you get
started with brainstorming an idea for your team's project and putting together
a proposal to submit to the Apex team.

### Step 1: Form a team

Putting together a proposal, designing a project, and building it is no easy
task. For that reason, we require you to do form a team of 2-4 people. While it's not impossible to do it by yourself, working with a team
will not only be a lot easier on you, but it will also be a lot more fun! We also have a limited amount of weight that we can launch, so we want to maximize the number of people who can work on a project. 

If you already have a team, that's great! Make sure everyone
[signs up for Apex](https://forms.hackclub.com/apex) individually, and when it
comes time to submit a proposal, make sure to include everyone's names.

If you don't already have a team (or would like more members), that's also
great! Talk around in the [#apex](https://apex.hackclub.com/slack-channel) channel
on the Hack Club Slack, and you'll find someone cool to work with on your Apex
project :)

### Step 2: IDEAS!

Here's your situation: you've signed up, you've got a team, but you're missing
an idea. (Or, you've already got an idea for your project - if that's the case,
continue to [Step 3](#step-3-writing-a-proposal).)

#### Step 2A: Go crazy

When designing a project to launch on a high-altitude weather balloon, the sky's
really the limit! While there are many technical constraints outlined in
[Step 2B](#step-2b-http-420-enhance-your-calm), don't worry about those right
now. For now, just thing of anything and everything that could possibly yield
interesting results if launched 100,000ft into the air.

If you need some inspiration, here are some ideas and past projects that have been done. We encourage
you to make your project your own, though:

- Solar tracker
- Ambient static electricity collector
- Some sort of biochemistry experiment
- Balloon-launched rocket
- Glider launched from a balloon (hmm, funny, maybe [StratoSoar](https://github.com/crnicholson/StratoSoar-MK3))
- Chicken that poops glitter 
- High-altitude balloon tracking infrastructure (wait a second, is this [Tiny4FSK](https://github.com/New-England-Weather-Balloon-Society/Tiny4FSK)?)

#### Step 2B: Explore each idea in detail

You should now have a decently long list of potential project ideas. Now, it's
time to _enhance_. Get into the details of each idea! You'll probably find that
a couple ideas are simply too impractical (take a look at the
[project limitations](/resources/limitations)). You might be able to change the
concept slightly to make it better, or you might just have to scrap it. Other
ideas might sound good, but you have no idea how to make it happen. Don't worry!
_\<insert your favorite search engine here\>_ and the
[#apex](https://apex.hackclub.com/slack-channel) channel on Slack are your best
friends, and at least one of them will be able to point you in the right
direction.

Keep in mind that **you do not need to actually design anything for your project
at this step.** This step is purely to narrow down your list to just a couple
promising ideas that your team would like to build.

Once you've narrowed down the list, if you've just got one idea left, great!
Proceed to the next step. If you've got multiple promising ideas left, that's
awesome too! The deciding factor for what project you end up building will
ultimately be which one sounds more fun to your team.

Oh, and one last thing: your team should have between $300 and $400 to make your creation, so keep budget in mind!

### Step 3: Writing a proposal

You've made it a long way. You've formed a team, you've brainstormed ideas, and
now you've narrowed down those ideas to one that you'd really like to make.
Before you jump straight into designing and building, though, your team must
write a proposal. Don't worry, it doesn't need to be an essay! In short, the
proposal is for two things:

- Letting the Apex team know what you're building and making sure it's within
  the technical limitations
- Helping your team to describe your project with detail so that you have a
  clear goal when designing and building

With that said, here are the guidelines for the proposal:

- It should include the names of each member of your team
- It should have a project title
- It should briefly describe what the project will look like and what you expect
  from it (like a hypothesis)
- It should list the data that will be collected from the project
- It should give a rough idea of how the project will be constructed
  (components, electronics?)
- It should disclose any concerns about the project, such as potential safety
  issues or expensive components

Make sure to think through each element of this proposal carefully. It's OK if
there's still parts about the project that you're unsure of - just include that
in the proposal so that we can help you figure it out.

**When your team has finished the proposal, submit it on the
[Proposal Submission Form](https://forms.hackclub.com/submit-apex-proposal)! Proposals are
due on April 1st.**
