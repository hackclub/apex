title: Project Limitations
---

We're open to projects of all types, but please keep your designs within these
limitations. Your project will **NOT** be allowed to fly if it does not conform to
these limitations.

- Styrofoam enclosure (max. 12x12x12 freedom units)  
  - Check with the Apex team in the [#apex](/slack-channel) channel to clear your enclosure!  
  - Approval is required before using your box of choice.  
  - Pre-approved boxes:  
    - [https://www.amazon.com/ON17F-Thermo-Chill-Overnite-Containers/dp/B00UZBCTK8/ref=sr\_1\_7?sr=8-7](https://www.amazon.com/ON17F-Thermo-Chill-Overnite-Containers/dp/B00UZBCTK8/ref=sr_1_7?sr=8-7)
    - [https://www.amazon.com/Polar-Tech-207C-Insulated-Shipper/dp/B007ICA67U](https://www.amazon.com/Polar-Tech-207C-Insulated-Shipper/dp/B007ICA67U)
- Passes all tests  
- Does not interfere with the payload train  
  - Does not twist the cord  
  - Does not cut the cord (obviously\!)  
- ¾ lbs weight limit (would hit 103,000 ft)  
- Any radio transmissions must not interfere with onboard radio communications used for tracking the balloon (432.XXX MHz)  
- We strongly recommend all electronic experiments be powered off Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries, which are rated to work in \-40 deg C temperatures.  
- Use of red duct tape around corners.  
- Nothing that could create a spark (hydrogen is highly flammable\!)  
- Nothing that could be potentially hazardous (to both us or the experiments)  
- Nothing that could potentially interfere with radar systems\!  
- Enough space for a ⅜” vinyl tube to pass all the way through the payload box  
- Please attach 4 small placards around the sides of the payload box, and one large one on the top.

  - Secure with packaging tape
  - If you do not own a printer, let us know in the [#apex](/slack-channel) channel and we can print it at the launch site!

**Your proposal must be approved by the Apex team!**
