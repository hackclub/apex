_Please build your project following the directions [here](/resources/building)
before continuing._

You are now nearing the finish line and well on your way towards taking off!
However, there are still a few more steps to ensure your experiment flies
smoothly.

### Shipping

You may either ship your project in advance (you must pay for your own shipping)
or bring it with you on the day of the launch. We highly recommend bringing it with you, either via car or plane because you can make sure it's nice and safe. Also, please ensure that it is completely finished and adheres to the [limitations](/resources/limitations).

We are still working out an address to ship your project to, stay posted for details.
