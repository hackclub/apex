# Apex Website

![](real-website/public/logo.png)

The website for Apex Hacks 2025! It includes the website's home page, as well as
the Apex Resources wiki. The Apex Resources wiki is a collection of subpages on
the Apex website that guide participants of Apex with creating, designing, and
building their projects!

_What's Apex, you ask? Apex is a 3 month journey to launch projects 100,000 ft
into the air on high-altitude balloons in Boston! Check out the
[website](https://apex.hackclub.com) to learn more :)_

## Technical stuff

The Apex website is built using Astro and Tailwind CSS. These are both great
choices for the Apex website since we don't have any interactivity, and the Apex
Resources wiki is very content-heavy. Astro makes is super easy to organize
this, and Tailwind CSS makes it super easy to style.

In addition, this website also features a variety of API endpoints for time-tracking. These 
interface with both the time tracking application, and the [web-based time tracker](https://apex.hackclub.com/time).
